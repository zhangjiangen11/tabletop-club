class_name AdvancedRigidBody3D
extends RigidBody

## A [RigidBody] with more features, given a few constraints.
##
## This class assumes that there is one or more [CollisionShape] children, and
## that each of those children have exactly zero or one [MeshInstance] children.
## It also assumes that all [SpatialMaterial] used by the mesh instances are
## assigned to the [MeshInstance], not the [Mesh] inside.
##
## [b]NOTE:[/b] This class also assumes that the node structure of the children
## does not change throughout the game.
## [b]TODO:[/b] Test this class fully once it is complete.
